Welcome to the Advanced Utility System (AUS) repository! This project is an innovative approach to home security and automation, integrating various sensors and systems to create a smart, responsive environment.

## 🌟 Project Overview
AUS is designed to enhance home security and environmental monitoring through IoT technology. It incorporates a range of sensors and systems to detect and respond to various conditions like fire, flood, and unauthorized entry.

## 🗂 Repository Structure
- **`aus-ertugrul.ino`**: The main Arduino sketch that integrates all modules.
- **`buzzer.cpp/h`**: Controls buzzer for alarms and notifications.
- **`earthquake.cpp/h`**: Detects seismic activity and alerts accordingly.
- **`fire.cpp/h`**: Monitors for fire hazards and triggers alerts.
- **`flood.cpp/h`**: Detects potential flooding and activates preventive measures.
- **`heathum.cpp/h`**: Monitors temperature and humidity levels.
- **`led.cpp/h`**: Manages LED indications for various alerts and statuses.
- **`mail.cpp/h`**: Handles email notifications for alerts.
- **`other.cpp/h`**: Includes additional utility functions.
- **`panicb.cpp/h`**: Implements a panic button feature for emergencies.
- **`telegram.cpp/h`**: Integrates Telegram bot for remote monitoring and control.
- **`update.cpp/h`**: Facilitates over-the-air updates for the system.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Multi-sensor Integration**: A comprehensive approach to home security and environmental monitoring.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notifications via buzzer, email, and Telegram.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your home from anywhere using the Telegram bot.
- **OTA Updates**: Conveniently update the system without physical access.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
